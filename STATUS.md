## 2026-10-03

**Date:** October 3, 2026

**What changed:** Planning documents and Claude Code setup were loaded into the repo. That includes `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/blueprint.md`, `docs/mission.md`, the six subagents in `.claude/agents/`, and this status log. Clay locked the eight recommended defaults in the blueprint (public repo, 64-entrant singles, in-person only, Glicko-2, 12 months live / 24 months history, 2-hour refresh, Neon, neutral name and dark theme). Phase 0 has not started. No application code has been written.

**What's next:** Phase 0 (setup). The next session should read `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/blueprint.md`, and this file, then have the architect subagent write `docs/plans/phase-0.md` and `docs/plans/phase-1.md` before any app code.

**Questions for Clay:** None.

**Questions for Genghis:** None.
